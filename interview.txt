Created a list of interview questions for my purpose 

 1.What is method overloading?
 ans - Method overloading is also called compile time polymorphism, we use different methods with same name and 
 only difference is in type of data types, no of arguments etc.
 
 2.How do you handle divide-by-zero?
 and - Divide by zero is an arithmetic exception caused in java, it is handled by using try-catch block 

 3.Difference between == and .equals()?
 ans - Both are used to compare the values but difference is == compares the memory address of the object references
 and also it compares the value directly with the primitive data types, whereas .equals check actual value for  comparison.

 4.What are the basic data types in Java?
 ans -> Total 8 basic data types in java - byte, short, int, long, double, float, boolean, char.
  
 5.How is Scanner used for input?
 ans -> Scanner is a class in the java.util package used to read different types of input like
  int, double, String, etc., from various sources â€” most commonly from the keyboard (System.in).

 6.Explain the role of a loop.
 ans - > A loop in Java is used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. 

 7.Difference between while and for loop?
 ans - for loop is mainly used when we know the no of iterations whereas in while loop
  there is no need for the no of iterations it works directly on the condition

 8.What is the JVM?
 ans - JVM stands for java virtual machine which is a part of JRE, JVM is responsible to execute the byte code(.class file)
 which make java as platform-independent language.

 9.How is Java platform-independent?
 ans - java is platform-independent because it converts the source code to byte code(.class file). This byte code is not machine specific 
 or any operating system. It can be executed on any system which has jvm installed in it 


 10.How do you debug a Java program
 ans - 1. I use IDE debugger - step-in/step-out over method calls
       2. print statement to check the values 
       3. Exception stack trace - read errors to locate issues
       4. Junit testing
